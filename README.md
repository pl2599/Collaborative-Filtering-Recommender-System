### [Project Description](doc/)

Term: Spring 2018

+ Project title: Recommender System Algorithm Impementation and Evaluation
+ Team Number: Group 3 
+ Team Members: Alek Anichowski, Jerome Kafrouni, Pak Kin Lai, Chunzi Wang
+ Project summary: In this project we implemented model-based algorithm (EM Clustering) and memory-based algorithms (similarity weights used include Pearson correlation, Spearman correlation, Cosine Vector, Entropy, Mean Squared Difference, Significance and Variance Weighting) to built a collaborative filtering recommender system. We built these algorithms from scratch and then evaluated their performance on two datasets: implicit voting Microsoft Web Data and explicit voting EachMovie data.
+ Prediction Results:

### How this repository is organized

For this project we worked on two main types of models: memory-based models and model-based models. Therefore this repository contains two main R markdown files, one for each approach. Both these files are in the *doc* folder. For reproducibility purposes, precomputed matrices are included in the output folders and loaded at the beginning of these two main files, instead of having to run long chunks again.

In output, you will also find a pdf version of the slides that we used for our presentation.
